SQl Review Questions

Each apartment can have multiple tenants, and each tenant can have multiple apartments. Each apartment belongs to one building, and each building belongs to one complex.

	1. Write an SQL Query to get a list of tenants who are renting more than one apartment
		SELECT TenantName
		FROM Tenants
		INNER JOIN
			(SELECT TENANT ID FROM AptTenants GROUP BY TenantID HAVING count(*) > 1) C
		ON Tenants.TenantID = C.TenantID

	2. Write a SQL query to get a list of all buildings and the number of open requests
		SELECT BuildingName, ISNULL(Count,0) as 'Count'
		FROM BUILDINGS
		LEFT JOIN
			(SELECT Apartments.BuildingID, count(*) as 'Count'
			 FROM Requests INNER JOIN Apartments ON Requests.AptID = Apartments.AptID
			 WHERE Requests.Status = 'Open'
			 GROUP BY Apartments.BuildingID) ReqCounts
		ON ReqCounts.BuildingID = Buildings.BuildingID

	3. Building #11 is undergoing major rennovation, write a query to close all requests from apartments to this building
		UPDATE Requests
		Set Status = 'Closed'
		WHERE AptID IN (SELECT AptID FROM Apartments WHERE BuildingID = 11)

	4. What are the different types of joins? 
		Joins are used one two different tables with a shared field in order to combine their data.
		An Inner Join only combines elements which are in both tables
		An Outer Join has elements which are not shared by the tables in addition to the ones from Inner Join
		A Left Outer Join, or LEFT Join contains the elements from the left table, while the nonshared elements
			in the right table are filled with NULL
		A Right Outer Join, or RIGHT Join is the opposite of above
		A Full Outer Join has the elements from Inner Join, with the non matching elemented also added with a NULL Value

	5. What is Denormalization?
		Denormalization is when redundant data is added to a database in order to avoid costly joins.
