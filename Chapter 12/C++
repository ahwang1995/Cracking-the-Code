C++ Notes

Inheritance ex:
	class Person{
		...
	}
	class Student: public Person{
		public:
			...
	}
	int main(){
		Student* p = new Student();
		p->func(); //uses the function within student
		delete p; //deletes allocated memory
	}

Constructor ex:
	//for primitive types
	Person(int a){
		id = a;
	}
	//so that id is created before the object or constructor code
	Person(int a) : id(a){

	}
	//deconstructor
	~Person(){
		delete obj;
	}
