Thread Review Questions

1. What's the difference between a thread and a proccess?
	A process is an instance of a program in which resources such as CPU time
	and memory are allocated. Proccesses are excecuted in different address
	spaces and do not have direct access to eachother's resources. In contrast
	a thread is part of a proccess and shares it resources such as heap space while
	still having it's own memory and registers. Due to the shared heap space, threads within
	the same proccess have immediete access to changes in resources. Threads sare like a
	paths in a proccess.
