Java Review

Overloading is when two methods have the same name, but differ in the type of
arguments, while overriding is when two methods share the same name as another method
in the superclass

In the collections framework, an arraylist and vector have similar functionqality, the
difference being that a vector is synchronized when being accessed by multiple threads.

A linkedlist is a good example of using an iterator
	LinkedList<String> myLinkedList = new LinkedList<String>();
	...
	Iterator<String> iter = new myLinkedList.iterator();
	while(iter.hasNext()){
		System.out.println(iter.next());
	}

Hash map initialization
HashMap<String,String> map = new HashMap<String,String>();

13.1 Private Constructor
	The inner classes can access the private methods of a classes

13.2 Does the finally block get excecuted when a return statement is inserted in the
try block of a try catch finally?
	Yes, when the the try block exits, the finally block executes. The cases in which it
	doesnt get executed are when the virtual machine exits during the try catch or the
	thread executing the block gets killed

13.3 Final, Finally, and finalize
	Final
		This is used to control whether a variable, method, or class is changeable
		When applied to a primitive, the variable value cannot chang
		When applied to a reference, the variable cannot point to any other object on the heap
		When applied to a method, it cannot be overridden
		When applied to a class, a subclass cannot be made
	Finally
		This is used in a try catch block to make sure a segment of code is always executed
		Even if an exception is thrown, the statement in the finally block is still executed
	Finalize()
		This is a method used by the garbage collector once it is determined that no more
		references exist. This method is meant to be overridden since it executes right
		before garbage collection
