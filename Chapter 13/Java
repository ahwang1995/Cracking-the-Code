Java Review

Overloading is when two methods have the same name, but differ in the type of
arguments, while overriding is when two methods share the same name as another method
in the superclass

In the collections framework, an arraylist and vector have similar functionqality, the
difference being that a vector is synchronized when being accessed by multiple threads.

A linkedlist is a good example of using an iterator
	LinkedList<String> myLinkedList = new LinkedList<String>();
	...
	Iterator<String> iter = new myLinkedList.iterator();
	while(iter.hasNext()){
		System.out.println(iter.next());
	}

Hash map initialization
HashMap<String,String> map = new HashMap<String,String>();

13.1 Private Constructor
	The inner classes can access the private methods of a classes

13.2 Does the finally block get excecuted when a return statement is inserted in the
try block of a try catch finally?
	Yes, when the the try block exits, the finally block executes. The cases in which it
	doesnt get executed are when the virtual machine exits during the try catch or the
	thread executing the block gets killed
